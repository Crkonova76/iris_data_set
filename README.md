## Iris-data set introduction

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species -Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. 
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

## Statistics methods used:

### *Mean*
* The "average" number, found by adding all data points and dividing by by the number of data points

### *Standard Deviation*
* Quantifies the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values.A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.
